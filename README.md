# SHIPMENT-PRICE-PREDICTION


## Problem Statement

To create a machine learning-powered app that can predict the cost of shipping a package. Logistics companies can avoid losing money on delayed or damaged shipments by using machine learning, and they can also offer more competitive prices to attract customers.
Some of the factors that can influence the cost of shipping a package are as follows:

* Package weight and dimensions: The heavier and larger the package, the more it will cost to ship.
* Distance: The greater the distance the package must be shipped, the higher the cost.
* Mode of transportation: The mode of transportation used to ship the package affects the cost as well. Air freight, for example, is more expensive than ground shipping.
* Special handling requirements: The cost will be higher if the package requires special handling, such as refrigeration or hazardous materials handling.

Logistics companies can use machine learning to analyze historical data to learn how these factors affect shipping costs. This data can then be used to create a model that can predict the cost of shipping a package based on any set of inputs. This enables logistics companies to more accurately and dynamically price their shipping services, which can help them improve their bottom line and attract more customers.
